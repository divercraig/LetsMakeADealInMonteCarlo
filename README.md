# Lets Make A Deal In Monte Carlo
Monte Carlo Simulation to demonstrate the [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

This simple simulation plays the famous 3 doors game from Let's Make a Deal thousands of times with both strategies:
* Stick with the initial door chosen
* Switch to the other door after the host reveals that the prize in not behind one of the other doors

If the simulation is run with a large enough sample you will see that there is a clear winning strategy:
* Stick wins 33% of the time
* Switch wins 66% of the time
